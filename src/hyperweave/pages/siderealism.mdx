The Sun and it's planet people\
Are all aboard the star\
That we live in\
and sidereally are

To Siderealise\
Is to realise\
And materialise\
Your dreams\
As made by stars

As a holographic verb\
It means to style or to fashion\
To create your life\
with star-like passion

You're a Baby, You're a Star\
You're one of the flowers\
Growing from your fields\
Of planetary powers
